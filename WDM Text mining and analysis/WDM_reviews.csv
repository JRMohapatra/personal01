The property was bought via Zillow. The contractors that Zillow hired placed my former neighbors garbage and old furniture in front of my house. Literally, their discarded smelly trash was in front of my mailbox and ON MY PROPERTY! I was very professional and polite when I contacted the William  Douglas Property MGT Group. I left a voicemail at around 7:00pm yesterday and was contacted by a representative this morning. The representative that I spoke to, Mrs. Rihannon, practically rushed me off the phone and did not take the time to fully explain how I can resolve this issue nor did she seem to care.

I was instructed to send an email and a reference photo as she would then forward this communication to the on-site property manager. It is now end of day, and the trash (Which has a very strong odor) is still in front of my home. I called Ms. Rihannon back, and once again she rushed me off the phone, cut me off and made me feel unheard. This is terrible customer service and it is clear that this company is not customer focused or customer centric. I understand that we are all dealing with a lot during these times, however, you have a business to run. After reading the reviews, I must say I have some relief in knowing that I am not the only client that this mgt group has let down.

If a client or consumer is experiencing an issue, it is your duty as the good/service provider to assist the customer in bringing resolution to their issue while also remaining empathetic to their situation. Thank you for not exuding professionalism, customer service and great communication skills.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi777y2vGxmjrnazVZC1K3M60wX-C6LS_gYaY1JDg,"Zasmira,

We appreciate all feedback and thank you for yours. As association managers, our job is to handle the association's affairs including, but certainly not limited to, paying association bills, getting vendor quotes for regular maintenance and repairs, managing vendors, issuing violations, preparing the annual budget, and advising the board.

The person you reached was one of our service team.  She immediately passed the information on to the onsite association manager. However, there is a process of mailing violation letters with a time frame to allow them to address the matter, therefore the action by the violator typically is not immediately corrected, although it would be great if it were. I completely understand how mad you must be about the garbage left by your neighbor. It has been very hot lately and it must smell atrocious.

When I moved in, 90% of google reviews for WillIam Douglas Management were between 1-2 stars (somehow over the last month they’ve been flooded with 5 star reviews interestingly enough) so I wasn’t expecting great customer service from the beginning. That being said, I didn’t realize it could possibly be this bad.

My townhouse has various exterior repairs needed that the HOA is responsible for, that clearly should have been taken care of years ago. One of the repairs involves the water meters (we have our neighbors in our backyards) which we do not feel comfortable handling ourselves given that could result in messing with our neighbors water. It’s been 3 months since I initially wrote to Savannah asking about the repairs and have had to send at least 2-3 emails in a row every month in order to get any sort of response. Her most recent response was, “the HOA board has agreed we are responsible, but there is no timeline on repairs”.

Given I pay $240 per/month for HOA dues (a very outdated payment system not to mention), I found her response to be utterly absurd and asked to speak with an HOA board member or join a virtual HOA meeting to which I was told that she “could not provide me with HOA board member contact information” and “non HOA board members are not allowed to join virtual meetings because of COVID” (logical right?) and that I was to communicate with the board through her (which has clearly been impossible).

I would like to bring attention to the wonderful service I received from Ms. Yvonne Hughes. I am the owner of Carolina Clean Pressure Washing and recently did a large commercial job for William Douglas Property Management. Because of a simple miscommunication, I was unable to get paid for the job I had completed. After speaking to several people in accounting, I talked to Ms. Hughes and explained the situation. She said she would find out what the problem was and call me back. She called me back within an hour and got my check cut the same day! She then asked me how soon I needed it. I told her as soon as possible. She overnighted it and I got it the next morning!! You could say she was just doing her job, but she went above and beyond that. She was genuinely concerned about me and my situation. It is people like her that make a company successful. Thank you so much Ms. Hughes!! If I ever actually meet you, I am giving you a hug!!

Pictures are only taken of violations. In this case, there was an animal off leash and pet waste that was not being removed. Associations must issue violations to ensure that the property is being well maintained and that it follows the association rules as outlined in the governing documents. We encourage tenants to speak to their leasing agents to advocate on their behalf for any homeowner association related issues as they are the authorized managing agent of the homeowner.

We value all feedback and thank you for your review.  I am very sorry to hear about this situation.  I was both surprised and concerned when I read that you felt nothing had been done to repair a water leak. Our company places a high value on all management tasks, but a repair like this certainly shoots to the top of the task list when it comes up... so I immediately reached out to the manager to check the status of this work order.  I learned that the puddling water you mention is from an exterior water line that has unexpectedly broken in some fashion.  Because of the location, the plumbing contractor is legally obligated to call the city at 811 to have utility lines marked before the contractor may begin digging to locate the leak.  While the city has been contacted, they have not yet marked the lines.  This is not something your HOA or we, as the association managers, can expedite -- we are also at the mercy of the city.

One of the most challenging parts of managing associations is that many behind the scenes activities can occur with no visible effect at the property. I hope you understand that we are, and have been, following up with the plumbing vendor every single day.  If you have any questions or other concerns, I would love to hear from you.  My email is jreynolds@wmdouglas.com. Let me know if I can be of further assistance!

We appreciate all feedback and thank you for yours.  Association management companies are hired by the Board to manage the association and do not keep any of the dues collected on behalf of an association.  The association management company does not determine when to conduct maintenance.  An association manager absolutely can and does make recommendations to the Board, but can only execute what the Board authorizes them to do and what the association has the ability to do.   Ultimately, the Board decides what to do and when to do it.

Frequently, managers are on property conducting inspections, meeting with vendors, or are engaged in other tasks that may prevent them from answering the phone.  All messages and emails are prioritized according to urgency and receive responses within 24-48 hours.  If you find we do not meet that parameter, please let me know.  If you have any questions or other concerns, you may email me at jreynolds@wmdouglas.com.

I would be embarrassed to be a part of this company.

I rented a condo that was under their management. The contact was responsive to emails, but nothing ever happened after their response. I got tons of ""i'll look into it"" or ""thanks for letting me know"" and no action taken after requests.

They would also schedule work to be done and request us to prep condos or park in special places so they could do work. Of the three times this happened in one year, not once did the work take place when initially scheduled, nor did I get any updates that it was going to be rescheduled.

They fail to handle basic communication, or take care of situations for which they are paid. Horrendous. I will never buy/rent from somewhere under their management.

EDIT: I'll add some detail to respond to the owners response. My landlord has kept me very much in the loop on communications. Usually, about 2-5 MINUTES after he gets the email I have it forwarded to me. For back and forth's, I am copied on the conversations, sometimes via BCC. My requests/questions are sent to the landlord, who sends to WD and I see them sent and as stated above, typically the response. There could be a communication problem between all three groups (me, landlord, WD), but my opinion stays the same.

It is the homeowner responsibility to receive and share information with their renters.

It sounds like the homeowner association's property manager was working hard to make you feel heard and likely even did their best to act on the information you gave them.

I have nothing but positive attributes to relay about the property manager and the company. During my 11 years on the board, we have been through three other management companies. William Douglas and their property manager have successfully met every challenge. The property manager and the company have never let us down.

I read reviews on this site and another site to see if I recognized any of our HOA’s chronic covenant violators. I was hoping to respond specifically and give balance to those reviews. What I discovered is 95% of the complaints appear to be written by people who do not simply understand how HOAs function.

I wish to briefly comment on a few of these reviews and direct quotes:

- “Rude property manager” I have no idea if the manager was rude or not since I didn’t hear the conversation. Rudeness is subjective anyway. Yet, I can tell you the biggest complaint we got about our last management company’s manager, was not that he was “rude,” but that they would never respond to phone calls or emails. Thus, I can say it was never reported to the board that our last manager was rude. Yet, it is rude for the manager to never respond to any of the membership and towards the end not even to the board. I should have stated the prior management company’s managers, plural, instead of manager, singular. In the last six months of the contract we had 4 different managers. Yet, it was never reported that any of these 4 were ever rude, just unresponsive.

-“The manager will not work with me!” Does this reviewer think they are renters in an apartment? I assume they do not realize the board is calling the shots or that is how it works at our HOA.

-Collections – One reviewer has the same name as a guy in our HOA who is consistently late paying his dues. If this is the same guy, he did not mention this tiny little fact. I don’t enjoy paying dues either; yet, I don’t believe it’s fair for the rest of the HOA to carry me, like we carry him. My apologies if this is not the same person (you may want to consider a name change because there is a deadbeat in our HOA with the same name)

-“Landscaping looks terrible.” All I can say to someone like this is join the landscape committee. Heck we get all these type people complaining about our HOA’s landscaping. Yet, ask them to join the landscape committee and you will see what happens. You don’t have to worry about being stampeded by people signing up for the committee. Every annual meeting we get the same knucklehead complaining about the landscaper. When asked to join the landscaping committee, every year he is too busy. For the last three annual meetings when this imbecile’s gets up to talk, I go to the bathroom which is a more constructive use of my time than listening to this clod.

The reason I originally got on the board was we had the worst management company in town. They were just awful, they were cheap, but just awful. You would go to their office and it was an old rundown house. A real dump and these people were managing our HOA the same way they kept up that rundown house. They went out of business or sold to another company. The owner of this new company was a horse’s rear end. One of the meanest, nastiest personalities you would ever meet. This guy needed to be working in a basement somewhere where he would not have contact with other humans. Then we hired a company we thought would be better, they were better, however, that bar was low after our prior experience. We stayed with them for about 3 years. We had to find someone better. That is when we found William Douglas and have been with them ever since.

While no one is perfect, they are head and shoulders above the prior three management companies. I suppose if you do not know what an inferior management company is, it is easy to complain about their service. Yet, I know the difference.",https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Y302WY8-mk4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucmIqOE4u_5zoLerXTvyC0gSKMRQ9w/c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba3/photo.jpg,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience, Mike.

Many of these reviews are unwarranted and grossly undeserved.  Most people do not understand that William Douglas’s property managers act as is a point person for the HOA’s they assist in managing.  The vast majority of the negative interactions they have or the slow responses are due to the HOA’s Board of Directors enforcement of their Bylwas and/or Rules and Regulations and need in time to respond due to working full time jobs outside of their HOA volunteer duties.

My community has been with William Douglas for at least 15 years.  During that time, we have overall been happy (as a Board) with William Douglas and their services provided.  They are very responsive in an emergency and proactive in assisting in the collections of dues which are vital in the operation of our community.

During my time in the community (12 years) and on the Board (5 years), I have had the pleasure of working with several different property managers.  Our current manager is Reem Rakes and we could not be happier.  She is very proactive with our needs, provides us with concise and direct communications from our residents and vendors, provides us sound judgement and opinions based on the law and her personal experiences, and is overall a pleasent, mild mannered, and intelegant person.

We appreciate all feedback and thank you for yours.  Generally speaking, the board and/or the governing documents for an association are what determine what is a violation and when a violation should be written.  It is a common misconception that management companies determine violations! I understand your frustration, but it sounds like your frustration is with your association and not with us.  We can only execute as explicitly authorized and specifically at the direction of a Board.

If you would like to discuss this further, I would be happy to hear from you.  You can reach me at jreynolds@wmdouglas.com.

I live in a very large townhouse community that had experienced its fair share of issues. Since coming under the service of WD, specifically Reem Rakes, our community has done a 360 in appearance and quality. Reem is excellent about communicating community policy and assisting us in enforcing rules the prior company did not. She is very responsive to my emails and always provides accurate information. Naturally, many tenants are not happy about the rules enforcement but that is the desire of the Board and Reem works with us to ensure our wishes are met. I see some pretty negative reviews about Reem but they appear to be from disgruntled tenants who do not want to follow simple rules such as acquiring parking passes, keeping the outside of their units clean, place their trash bin behind their unit on time, or parent their children.
