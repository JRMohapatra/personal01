Additionally, after having our team look into your account, it would seem we have an outstanding email from 12/22.

We would like to thank you for your efforts to pay your HOA dues in a timely manner! Our agent is most likely correct here. HOA dues are considered late if not received by the 1st.

Many Boards allow for a grace period to accommodate mail and payment processing time. Anywhere from 5 - 30 days grace period is normal. In your community, if your grace period is 15 days, yes, if your payment is received on the 16th day, your account is subject to late fees (because, ultimately, the payment should have been received on or before the 1st).

Late fee removal is subject to Board approval and normally requires extenuating circumstances (i.e. being in the hospital, losing your job, death of a loved one, etc).

Here is a simple way to check a company's legitimacy: Check out the company's address, phone number, and website to make sure they look legitimate. Be aware, though, that it's pretty easy for a company to get a fake address, phone number, and website. If you can, visit the company's physical address and talk to the people who work there.

Many homeowners are concerned about violation enforcement in the community that they are rightly concerned and/or upset about. However, there is only so much an HOA can do to enforce its rules.

1. Warning Letters – Many HOAs choose to send Warning Violation Letters to homeowners once a violation has been identified. Many times, this helpful reminder is all that’s necessary for the violating homeowner to correct the issue.
2. Fines – After letters have been sent, HOAs have the right to fine their homeowners because of violations. Fines can vary from $15/month to $100/day depending on the violation and community.

Even with both of these enforcement methods, sometimes, it is not enough to convince the violator to correct the situation.

It has been a rough start as there have been numerous communications mailed / emailed out related to paying the first quarterly HOA fee. I received both mail and email directions. I mailed in all the paperwork to set up an ACH draft. Then, I received an invoice in the mail with directions on how to make a online payment. From my perspective, this meant that I needed to pay the HOA fee and that the ACH was not set up. So, I paid the fee online. Then, I noticed in my bank account that Cedar Management was processing an automatic payment for the same amount after my online payment. I called Cedar Management and alerted them to the issue. I spoke to Customer Service three times. I spoke to accounting staff two times. I told them that they needed to stop processing the second payment. They told me they would have to confirm with Bank of America. I sent them a screen shot of my bank account. They ignored my request to stop the second payment. Needless to say, the next day, Bank of America had indeed drafted my bank account twice for the same payment because Cedar Management did not listen to me when I alerted them to the problem. I called to speak to the Accounting Manage, Greg. He said that the only option I have now is to receive a check for the amount they drafted twice. I expressed my great frustration with their service because they made the choice to not listen to me. Which, in the end, has cost me $222.00 for two weeks. Greg said that he was not aware of the problem. Which means that when the accounting staff told me they would bring it to the attention of the manager, they did not. So, in the end, I lost the use of $222.00 and had to spend more than 45 minutes of my free time cleaning up their mistake.

Our mission is to provide exceptional support to the homeowners in our communities. Our turnaround time for email responses is regularly 1 - 2 days, although sometimes goes as far as 3+ days depending on the request (accounting requests usually take a bit longer to account for the research needed).

Regarding ""enforcement"", we assume you're speaking about the violations in your community. Many homeowners call and email about violations in their community that they are rightly concerned and/or upset about. However, there is only so much an HOA can do to enforce its rules.

Here are the two main ways an HOA can use to enforce its rules.
1. Warning Letters – Many HOAs choose to send Warning Violation Letters to homeowners once a violation has been identified. Many times, this helpful reminder is all that’s necessary for the violating homeowner to correct the issue.
2. Fines – After letters have been sent, HOAs have the right to fine their homeowners because of violations. Fines can vary from $15/month to $100/day depending on the violation and community.

Even with both of these enforcement methods, sometimes, it is not enough to convince the violator to correct the situation.

If ever you have a questions about what is and is not approved in your community feel free to email us at violations@mycmg.com! It would be our pleasure to serve you!",1611538164,1/25/2021 1:29,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s104737440748042468064!2s0x0:0xa3432a72da873d77?hl=en-US,1,1611494291,1/24/2021 13:18,0

Your Community Manager has reached out to you directly.

We have received your maintenance request regarding the termite matter and your manager is working on the situation with the Board & Pest Control vendor that the HOA has a contract/termite bond with. Unfortunately, the vendor was not out as quick as you requested due to their schedule.

The HOA continues to have landscaping maintained in the common areas and there have been ongoing pool issues. The Association has worked with the pool management company to get the pool open as soon as possible. This year has been difficult with unexpected repairs and of course the Covid situation. It's not ideal to have the pool closed but the HOA has to ensure the safety of all homeowners and that its in working order.

Our system has not been down, so we are not sure what system you might be referring to. HOA dues payments received after the community grace period are subject to late fees. Late fee removal is subject to Board approval. We do not have the authority to remove late fees.

An HOA absolutely must collet money so that it can fulfill its responsibilities but this is not the only way they serve. The HOA typically oversees the following areas:

Maintaining Common Areas: An HOA is responsible for common areas such as green spaces, amenities, or community buildings. They should repair any damages, replace or upgrade systems, and ensure proper aesthetics and safety.

Investigating Complaints: An HOA is also responsible for investigating any complaints made by members. This could include issues with property not being properly maintained, plumbing being backed up, sidewalks being cracked, or water leaking into their home. The Association must determine whether these issues originate from something that is under their jurisdiction or the homeowner’s.

Enforcing Rules: An HOA must also enforce established rules to protect property value and the integrity of the community.

As the manager for your community, it is our job to assist the HOA board in the enforcement of your association's covenants. We also want to take a moment respond to your concerns and hope that we can help clear things up.

In reference to your association not having an onsite manager, the HOA must be able to budget for this. Assuming the HOA does have a budget, the Board of Directors would ultimately make the decision on whether or not an onsite manager is the best use of the association's funds. The use of an onsite manager is not one that we make for the association. These decisions are made by the volunteer HOA board members that live in your community.

In regards to the rule enforcement, we coordinate with every HOA board on rules that are enforced. Our goal is to enforce the covenants fairly and consistently. Sometimes infractions are missed when one of our agents performs an inspection. Sometimes an infraction may occur without our knowledge. We do not ""pick and choose"" rules to enforce and we do not randomly single out individuals. If you see infractions in the community that need to be addressed, please report them to us so that we can coordinate with your HOA board and follow-up with appropriate actions.

You can go to our website at https://www.mycmg.com/homeowner-central to submit a violation. You can select the form from the drop-down list on the page and attach the photos. All violations reported to us are kept confidential and only shared with your HOA board for verification.

Also, violations do not make money for the HOA and they are not a profit center for our company. HOAs may pay a small fee for the printing and postage of each violation letter sent to an owner. The goals for issuing violation letters is to enforce the community's governing documents and rules. Our goal is to provide consistent enforcement to ensure fairness for all homeowners and to help maintain the association’s property values.

We came to them with a list of issues, one of which is endangering the residents of one of our buildings, and have been promised bids and haven't even received one. In five months. Our first property manager hardly ever responded to us. Her boss assigned us a new one who she promised would get in touch right away. She hasn't. We've also experienced many of the same billing frustrations and mistakes that others have reported. I've never written a google review before but this situation is so frustrating and unacceptable that everyone on the board is doing everything they can to get any attention at all. I've noticed that most of Cedar's reviews have been either 1 or 5 stars. What neighborhoods are getting 5-star service? Are they large ones (that bring more $$ to Cedar)? Are they fake reviews?

We're sorry to hear about your frustrations. We are aware of deck problems and wood rot from the years of neglect prior to us starting with your association in December. We have been working to get bids and already have vendors that we are communicating with. We are also dealing with the fact that your association was underfunded and had very limited funds (less than $10k) when we transitioned from your old company. The reason it feels like we were doing the bare minimum is because there was the bare minimum to work with.

These are major issues and we are aware of the implications but this will take time (and money) to resolve. We are frustrated with these issues just as you are. However, a negative review on Google is not going to speed up the process or make things magically get better.

We have passed your comments along to your community manager and their supervisor and someone will be reaching out to you to discuss your concerns.",1556295227,4/26/2019 16:13,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s115337075117301714258!2s0x0:0xa3432a72da873d77?hl=en-US,1,1556135312,4/24/2019 19:48,23

Here are my thoughts.

1) To start, it appears that the majority of the reviews on this page are fake.  I get it, businesses are pressured to make sure they have good Google reviews.  But you know how you get a great Google reviews? Be a great company.  Serve the customer with excellence.

2) On the whole, Cedar Management leaves much to be desired.  On the positive side, they do just enough for a community in terms of processing dues and handling of individual account issues.  While you cannot often get ahold of them by phone, they are more responsive by email or web chat.

3) Beyond that, Cedar Management offers little value or competitive advantage.  The problems begin at the top.  In the past five years, we have been through four community managers.  Property manager inexperience combined with too many assigned properties has to significant turnover.  Cedar Management needs to stop invest in their business by investing in attracting and retaining staff.  Penny pinching in this area has led to poor customer service.

Property managers have not even done enough to get by.  Our HOA has gone through multiple months of neglect.

4) Cedar has been slow to adapt to technology and what technologies it does offer is difficult for the HOA or the end user to take advantage of.

5) Cedar Management has subpar connections to vendors.  You would think that a firm with as many properties as they have would have a better vendor network.

In sum, your community should join ours in looking elsewhere.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--lznZKu_nLg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucmZsHWSJqFrjLV8B5-UYl0QOhmheg/c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba4/photo.jpg,"Thank  you for taking the time to give us your detailed feedback. We're so sorry that you feel this way! Our goal is the total satisfaction of our communities, and to provide a positive and professional experience. As such, we respond to all requests and emails as quickly as possible.
1) Fraudulent Gmail account reviews are against Google's terms and business's will get penalized for such practices. We routinely survey our clients, vendors, homeowners, and Board Members to solicit their feedback.
2) We appreciate this point! It is definitely faster to communicate via email and web chat. We encourage homeowners to use these instead of calling when possible as it's a very effective way to communicate.
3) We understand that it's frustrating when you have a manager reassigned to your association. Unfortunately, we cannot comment directly on every single one, but this often happens for various reasons including managers being promoted or having to be moved to other associations or termination of employment.
4) Our mission is to constantly update our technology to stay on the cutting edge so that the communities we serve always get the latest and best service possible.
5) We have an excellent vendor network. If your community is struggling with a particular project or vendor, please let your Community Manager know.

In sum, we will have your Community Manager reach out to your Board of Directors in order to assist you and your community better. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any further questions or concerns!",1589480259,5/14/2020 18:17,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s101646937376056369785!2s0x0:0xa3432a72da873d77?hl=en-US,2,1587134880,4/17/2020 14:48,4

I am on the Board of Directors of a community and have enjoyed working with Cedar and the staff.  The association management industry is very difficult and requires knowledge of the rules and regulations for each community.  Many homeowners don't understand these rules or don't care to take the time to invest in understanding them.  This leads to issues that our Board or Cedar can't control.  Reading over the recent reviews posted here,  I can tell that many of these are homeowners who don't understand the industry or what an associations purpose is.  My experience with Cedar is they have been very proactive, working to help us achieve our goals and continue our community operations in a positive direction.  Our budget has improved each of the past three years as we have worked with Cedar to review budget line items and find ways to cut cost while not reducing service to our community.  We have been able to hold back on some increases in our dues and are working to try and limit those in the future.  We have stopped reacting to maintenance issues  and have started being proactive in our approach to these.  We have worked to address rentals homes and other violations.  I was not on the Board when Cedar was selected but I can say they have been extremely helpful and professional to work with and the staff have worked very hard to assist our owners when they have concerns.  I highly recommend them not only here but to those that I interact with in my day to day business.",https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ej5MDyhHOfo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucnMqPt4FGSl6KDOGDB1jlF8ckxG0A/c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg,"Kyle, Thank you for the extensive review.

I was a committee chairperson and lead the social program prior to becoming a Board member two years ago.  I wanted to say how helpful Scott and the Cedar team have been in getting our community on the right track. We first retained Cedar in 2012 and based on other Board member feedback they put together a plan to help us decrease our accounts receivable and get our community looking better.  Our issue at the time was that the previous management company had not helped our Board understand options regarding collections and outstanding balances from homeowners.  Not having the appropriate funds our Board and committees were unable to make the decision to maintain our common elements and continue to improve our community.  With the effort of the accounting team and the association attorney we made strides to improve our collection rate and get our budget under control.  This lead to additional uncollected funds begin collected and used to improve our pool area and play ground.  Cedar also assisted our community in the NC grant program and with their help we were able to receive grant money for our new park area and improvements to our main community entrance.  Since being on the Board the progress has continued and we have enjoyed working with our manager and other Cedar team members to develop strategies for our community that ensure we will have a bright future ahead.  Thank you to our manager, Holly and the entire Cedar team for the hard work and effort over the past 4 years. We are excited to work with you in the future.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ghq6ld2Mp6wmWewjfRwuINGzQ1GTCBSS9HKF9zFnw,"Thank you Brenda.

We hate to see the negative review. We have never accepted cash for HOA dues payments and have many reasons for doing so. Accepting cash payments creates liability issues, increases probability for accounting errors, and creates a safety issue for our employees as cash based businesses are at greater risk for a potential robbery.

We offer multiple payment options including check, money order, ACH draft, and online payments. If you do not want to write a check, you can use your bank's online bill pay service and they will send a check on your behalf.

If you would like more information or have further questions, please email us at help@mycmg.com and we'll be happy to assist you.",1580391660,1/30/2020 13:41,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s101476118609832928182!2s0x0:0xa3432a72da873d77?hl=en-US,1,1580328907,1/29/2020 20:15,3

I was a committee chairperson and lead the social program prior to becoming a Board member two years ago. I wanted to say how helpful Scott and the Cedar team have been in getting our community on the right track. We first retained Cedar in 2012 and based on other Board member feedback they put together a plan to help us decrease our accounts receivable and get our community looking better.

Out issue at the time was the previous management company had not helped our Board understand the various available options regarding collections and outstanding balances from our homeowners. Not having the appropriate funds, our Board and committee were unable to make the decision to properly maintain our common elements and continue to improve our community.

With the effort of the accounting team and the association attorney we made strides to improve our collection rate and get our budget under control. This lead to additional uncollected funds being collected and used to improve our pool area and playground. Cedar also assisted our community in the NC grant program so with their help we were able to receive additional funds for our park area and main community entrance.

Since being on the Board the progress has continued and we have enjoyed working with our manager and other Cedar team members to develop strategies for our community that ensure we will have a bright future ahead. Thank you to our manager, Holly, and the entire team for the hard work and effort over the past 4 years.

Spent 30 minutes trying to get help setting up our first autopay and was told conflicting information over and over again - they were literally talking in circles. I mailed my form in by the deadline yet they failed to deduct the payment from my account and sent me a bill. When I logged in online to set up autopay and to pay the bill manually, the website didn't even work and they can't find my account at all. I called them and spent well over 5 minutes waiting on their VOICEMAIL SERVICE. I've left a message for a callback but have low expectations at this point. RIDICULOUS, unprofessional process, website, and staff.

We are sorry to hear about your experience. We received your message about why your October payment was not drafted. Because we took over for the association effective October 1st, we are not able to process ACH draft the first month of managing your association.

On the welcome letter that we sent, it stated that we must receive the ACH forms by the 20th of the month in order for the ACH draft to take effect the following month. We did not receive your ACH draft form until 10/22, which is past the deadline for us to be able to draft in November.

We tried to call you this morning at approximately 8:30AM and left a voice message.

I am the President of our community which consist of a mix of patio homes, single family homes and condominiums.  Our manager is Tracey and she has been fantastic to work with.  The follow up and attention to detail has allowed our Board of Directors to focus on more important issues.   With almost 600 homes in our community and a tremendous amount of ammenties, we have plenty to keep ourselves busy.  Our monthly reports are detailed and very easy to read and understand.  Having backup documentation in electronic format is also very helpful and has allowed us to be more focused on expenses and the budgeting process for the upcoming year.  We also enjoy the no cost owner portal and website.  This has allowed our owners to be able to access information real time and has reduced the amount of questions we receive as a Board from our fellow owners. Cedar has assisted us in reviewing our insurance for cost savings and was able to cut those cost by almost two thousand dollars.  We have added a key fob system at our pool and improved security for our clubhouse and tennis court areas.  We have reduce legal expenses and most of our our administration cost have been reduce by almost 75%, compared to our previous management company.   Making the decision to change companies was not an easy one for our Board of Directors, but I am glad we did make the change.  I highly recommend Cedar Management Group to those communities who are searching more a more proactive, customer focused management company.

The interesting thing is that the issues I'm running into, I realize that others experienced these same issues.  The payment processing for Cedar is flawed.  I've never had so many issues trying to give my money to anyone in my life.

I currently use Auto Bill Pay through my banking system, which I use for quite a few recurring bills, which performs an Auto Check that is sent on the 1st of every month.  Typically these payments can take up to 1-3 business days to process before I see the money pulled from the account.

In February of this year my wife noticed that our account showed that we owed double the amount that we normally pay month-to-month, so I called Cedar Management Group to ask why I was being double-billed.  What we found is that the payment for October's fees that are set to Auto Pay on the first day of each month got kicked back to my account for the payment scheduled for November 1st.  I called Cedar Management Group and was told that the payment was probably bounced back because there wasn't an assessment charged or in at that time.  So essentially my account balance was at $0 at the time that my payment was sent, so it was returned.  Since I have auto-payment set up I never noticed that this happened, especially since this has NEVER happened with any of my other bills.

At that time I asked if I could just go ahead and send a payment so that I could get my balance down to $0, but the person on the phone couldn't help me.  They did say I could pay online or over the phone but I would be charged a service fee and percentage for doing that.  I told them that I would just like to pay my balance without having to be charged a fee for an issue with their payment system.  The other thing I did was adjust my Auto-Bill Payment to pay on the 3rd of each month to avoid the issue with their system bouncing my money back after I try to pay them.  If it would be better for them and make it so I don't have to worry about my money not being accepted I am willing to set up ACH and have the money pulled from the account each month without having to worry about writing a check or thinking that the system will not accept my money.  The problem is that the account has to be $0 and apparently they can't help me pay this without having to charge some sort of fee.

I don't think it's right to charge a late payment for an account that we can't even pay early on, and that I have an auto-payment set up for.  The worst part is that I wasn't even notified that the payment was bounced back in the first place, so it was up to me to report it to Cedar and then in turn they charged us a late fee.

The other thing I noticed is that even after my bank shows the money coming out and being accepted by Cedar, their systems still don't show that it has been paid.  My Auto-Bill pay shows that it was sent on 4/3 and accepted and pulled from my account on 4/4.  I just got off the phone with a nice lady who told me she doesn't see any payment showing in her system.

Please feel free to contact me and let me know if you have any questions.  I really just want to be able to pay my bill and not have to worry about being charged late fees for issues on the backend.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgGVfbS9aIHxzwogaDNZ098Tc9ISN0jZBHubSB-,"Sean-

Cedar Management’s Accounting department evidently don't have People who can perform or understand maintaining accounts. One issue that they truly need to work on is posting payments on date of receipt and not the date of processing bulk of payments.

I was selling my property and I had a small balance on my account.  I paid the balance to zero on the same day the closing rep requested the HOA information so the balance still showed. As a result, when I closed I had to again pay the small balance in my closing cost. I tried to have the rep take my proof that my account had no outstanding balance, but was told Cedar Management would charge $100 to update the document since the request would be needed in less than three days. I knew it would be an issue if my refund was left to Cedar Management to return. And guess what, it was. Although I paid this company twice I was told there is no overpayment and my account shows no balance. So my question is, did they not keep documentation of what they sent out In order to ensure all monies were received and accounted for accordingly?  My answer is, No because if they had then my account would have been credited the overpayment to be refunded. Although I showed Cedar Management the documentation I was still told they don’t owe me anything. I believe this is a result of their staff not understanding documents they request. This company has no clue what they are doing?  I'm so happy I don't have to deal with them anymore but I want this issue to be resolved as I'm only asking for what I'm owed.

Follow up - I appreciate someone taking the time to review my account after going back and forth. I've received notice that I will be sent a check for my overpayment-Thank you. I feel all this could have been eliminated if someone would have been available to discuss issues and not rely on back and forth emails or having the customer service reps to handle calls that they can not assist on due to a department issue. Although i m happy this will be taken care of, it doesn't resolve my experience on posted payments in an untimely fashion. More n be done to ensure customer service when handling people financials on one of the biggest purchases people make, their home.",https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BlzeATIIP30/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuclW9X5pvsfEj9Oddl9fYqEM4Sakfw/c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg,"Tamika-

We are sorry to hear about your experience. Occasionally mistakes happen - and we admit it when we make them. And in this case, it looks like we made a mistake. We had informed you that a refund would be issued back when the check cleared. However, we were missing the HUD statement and did not realize it. When you followed- up on April 17th, we immediately started working to correct the mistake. By Monday April 22nd, everything was cleared up and a refund check was sent back to you.

We would appreciate an acknowledgement from you and updating or removing your review.

I have been in the customer service industry all my life, and am very demanding when it comes to customer service. I am a homeowner in an HOA managed by Cedar and got a violation letter in the mail. I called Cedar today to discuss the violation. They explained in detail what the violation was over the phone, then by the time the call was over, I had an email with the photo of my violation included. It was my fault – I didn’t realize our neighborhood did not allow certain things n the front yard. The email from the customer service person even had the section of our documents highlighted so that I could tell right off that I was in violation. I have since corrected this and all is well. The person I spoke with was very polite and professional – not to mention my issue was resolved in minutes. I was barely even on hold before they picked up. I also like that they asked for my phone number and email to update their records – I’m going to implement that with my team at work as well.

""The ARC Committee stated that your shed does not meet the guidelines because it does not match the existing color of the home and would need to have a shingled roof to match the home as well.""

We can send past due notices via mail and email and your association also has a web portal that allows you to access your account balance.

However, if there is no communication regarding a delinquent payment, the association can choose to take legal action for collecting payment and will turn over a homeowner to an attorney's office to ensure that all legal requirements are followed for collecting the debt for the past due fees.

In the future, please ensure that your HOA dues are paid in a timely manner to avoid any potential late fees or legal fees.

Sorry to hear you feel this way. We actually don't enjoy fining homeowners. However it's part of our job to help the board enforce the rules of the community. Please understand that fines are approved by your community's Board of Directors. Those fines are paid to your HOA. We have no benefit in fining a homeowner.

In regards to emails, we always respond to emails unless there's a problem - emails get caught by our spam filter, a homeowner makes threats or uses violent language, etc.

We understand you are frustrated and hopefully we can help you.

In regards to the ""very steep"" HOA fee increase - your Board of Directors is responsible for the budget and determining the HOA dues. Your HOA dues only increased by $5 from $140 to $145 per year. We're confused as to why you say this is ""very steep."" If you are concerned about the dues, we encourage you to speak with a board member in your community and attend the annual meeting for the association to address your concerns.

In regards to the solicitors - we have no control over their behavior. If your community has signs for ""No Solicitation,"" then you can contact your local police department to have someone come out if you see solicitors in the neighborhood.

In regards to the community's upkeep -  We can assist with selecting landscaping vendors for the community however the Board is responsible for the services the association pays for.  If you have concerns about the appearance of your association, we encourage to reach out to your board or use the ""Contact Your Board"" form at www.mycmg.com.

In regards to the violation letters, we show a record of two violation letters - November 2018 and March 2018. The violation letter that was sent to your account for mildew and exterior cleaning was removed from your account. If you would like to dispute any violations, please send an email to help@mycmg.com with your association name and property address and we'll have the community manager review your request with your Board of Directors.",1554125007,4/1/2019 13:23,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s106829875584492211195!2s0x0:0xa3432a72da873d77?hl=en-US,1,1553965520,3/30/2019 17:05,11

We're sorry to hear about your experience. We do occasionally experience longer hold times that normal. Typically these happen the first two weeks of the quarter due to the increased billing volumes. We also provide a web portal at no cost to your association that allows you to login and view your account. This information is provided on the invoice that we send to you as a homeowner.

Transaction fees are charged for credit and debit cards because Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, etc. all have fees that they charge to process payments on their network. The bank's processing fees are passed to the homeowner, otherwise, the association would be responsible for those fees. You do not pay transaction fees when you use your card in a store or a restaurant because the store is building their costs into to the purchase price of the product you are buying.

We offer a variety of payment options to pay your dues. We provide ACH draft for free. You can also use online bill pay through your personal bank's website for free. Just put the name of your association as the payee and be sure to include your account number in the memo field.

In the future, if you would like to contact us, we encourage you to call or email us at help@mycmg.com. If you need access to your account or account balance, we would encourage you to use the free web portal which you can access 24/7.

When hired, CMG introduced us a property manager who lives in Raleigh; yet, our property is located in Greensboro. To date owners do not know who is managing our property and receive the run-around when making an effort o reach the individual via telephone. Based on the conditions of my building and its landscape (see attached images), I withheld my HOA fees this past fall as an attempt to force the HOA to conduct major repairs. Eventually, I began paying my outstanding balance December 2018 to avoid being one of the ""Dead Beats"" I complain about with my neighbors; yet, $183 remained unpaid as of January 1, 2019. CMG's attorney made an attempt to notify me via certified mail only for me to make an online payment that same night wherein I paid the entire balance January 25th. The law firm released my account as of February 6, 2019; yet, a block remains present to date that is preventing me from making an online payment.

Now, when I made a large payment December 2018, I completed CMG's Automatic Draft document granting them permission to withdraw monthly payments at the beginning of each month from my checking account. I was informed by CMG the account needed to be current in order for the Automatic Draft payment plan to become active, so why did CMG fail to activate it at the beginning of February? Not only was a block present for the online payment option, my account remained flagged at CMG's office after its attorney submitted a legal document declaring my account was current on February 6, 2019. Concerned that my account would become delinquent, I mailed a bank check to CMG via certified mail to pay for both February and March dues near the end of March because CMG declined to speak with me to resolve the matter due to my account being flagged by their error. Once CMG responded via email, they declared I owed for both March and April 2019 only. To confirm I owed for April 2019 only, I submitted pictures of the $450 bank check, envelope, and the apple shaped memo that was enclosed stating my situation. Eventually, CMG acknowledged the $450 check being applied to my account only to distribute an April 2019 invoice stating  I owed over $700 for April 2018 (refer to attached image). I cannot take this company serious.

As of today, I have made four attempts during the month of April alone to have the block removed so I can make an online payment for the month, and the problem remains unsolved. Legal associates of the law firm CMG uses to collect outstanding dues have been copied on my emails and they have yet to respond either. I have never experienced such unethical and unprofessional service from a property management company until CMG was hired. Based on the reviews I have read the past three months, CMG clearly has a major flaw in its Finance Department wherein individual accounts are not being updated in a timely manner.

After reading multiple reviews, I have noticed how CMG responds to negative Google reviews quicker than answering telephone calls from homeowners- and ALWAYS have a slick response! Since pictures speak a thousand words, I decided to upload several images to validate my complaint since CMG is not capable of resolving the matter via email. Whether the HOA made the decision to avoid repairing major building code violations until the City of Greensboro was notified or not, CMG is being paid to inspect the conditions of the buildings monthly in addition to prioritizing major repairs and maintenance to assure the safety of all individuals residing on the property. I truly appreciate a former renter informing the owners in my building of our rights to notify the City of Greensboro Code Compliance Department in order to have building code violations resolved in a timely manner.

If you are reading this review while considering hiring CMG to manage your community, please consider hiring another company for certain.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhmTsPp72z-1zoMFTTIxigp-rPYvTVwmp3TIPH0ww,"Angela- We are sorry to hear about your concerns with the association.

Our company and your HOA does not have any financial benefit in the foreclosure of your home.

Your Board of Directors govern the association and entrust us to fairly and consistently uphold the rules of the community, which you legally agree to when you purchase a home in an HOA.

Unfortunately we cannot comment publicly on your specific situation. However, we can say that we made multiple attempts to contact you to try and resolve the situation. We also offer payment plans in an effort to help delinquent owners. Multiple notices and warnings are sent and also mailed via certified mail before a foreclosure is issued.

Thank you for contacting us about your concerns. There are no owners in the community for Hackberry Place named Jessica Franklin.

We do not refuse to give balances to homeowners or refuse to return calls unless a homeowner has made threats against the company. In these cases, we give multiple warnings beforehand. However, if an owner continues to make verbal or legal threats against our staff, we are not allowed to speak on the phone and all communication must be in writing.

This has only happened with one homeowner in Hackberry Place. So if this happens to be you, this would explain why you are not getting returns to your calls. Please understand that we gave you multiple warnings to stop using profanity and to calm down so that we could speak with you about your concerns and yet you did not listen.

In regards to your special meeting to remove the board, we did not refuse to call the meeting. This is false information. We sent out the notices for the meeting this week and the meeting will occur on January 28th.

The reason for the lack of meetings is not the fault of our company, but because of internal issues with the board which we cannot comment on publicly.

If you have questions about your account and we are not allowed to speak with you on the phone, please emails us at help@mycmg.com for assistance and we can respond in writing. Please note that we will NOT respond to threatening or profane messages.",1547759737,1/17/2019 21:15,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s110130985212478926417!2s0x0:0xa3432a72da873d77?hl=en-US,1,1547756730,1/17/2019 20:25,11

Then I responded by showing them again a part of the covenant that states home owners are automatically members of the community.  They have not responded and refuse to do anything.  I called the police over the weekend and the officer addressed the noise issue, but, he confirmed that the HOA should address the vehicle parking in front of our house (which is why we can hear the noise at night so loudly).  I dont know if the rediculous responses are being fed to us from our HOA via cedar management- or just from cedar management alone - but it seems to me this management company is extremely useless.

At our expense ..and what I consider their error... we had to schedule a SECOND community budget meeting with ANOTHER $200 for hall rental and Cedar’s  expensive mailing cost ( I believe it is $1 a page ) to all in the community again.  They supposedly fixed the budget , we were to review it with the new numbers.  NOTE: Our property manager said A BUDGET IS AUTOMATICALLY RATIFIED WITHOUT A QUORUM as long as the board approved it. That is concerning since our HOA board missed  major errors the first time around but thankfully the homeowners caught them . A budget begins with precise bookkeeping which Cedar is responsible for and it is difficult to interpret a budget without it. Problems still are not resolved.

Cedar is not particularly polite when you have a problem with them and they have to deal with you .Cedar hasn’t answered my calls. My neighbors complained that they seem to have problems keeping track of HOA dues they have paid.",https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--OQaZLo7duA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucmQQmFV3eZw8yb9Z8pyJBI5lwE4JQ/c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg,"Diane- We are sorry to hear about your concerns.

I have been trying for months to handle a dispute over late fees, unfairly placed on my account. After emails and phone calls, no justice!!
They keep saying they will let our board know, but yet not one phone call, letter, or email from the board. I am holding both accountable. It is obvious tbey do not believe in communicating with the homeowner. Silence is a big sign of GUILT! The board had a private meeting to change when a payment will be considered late. They didn't notify the homeowners after making a change. Our coupon still read ""late fees accessed after the 30th of the month. The board then placed late fees on my account in September. The clincher is, I asked them to be removed off my account due to the unfair way it was done (sneaky way). And going forward I would pay by the 15th. Cedar Management  keep accruing late fees for the late fee each month. A late fee that I really do not owe!! The board sent out a letter dated November 7th 2018 notifying us of the new change. But late fees were put on my account 2 months before.?? I am so upset with the way I have been ignored!! Some service!!

A reasonable fee, like cities charge, for transaction processing is between $1.25 and $2.95. This completely covers the cost of a typical $100 quarterly fee paid online. 3% is a normal nominal charge. Change your usury policies Cedar. Ten percent is completely abnormal. No justification.

Convenience fees are not a profit center. At ten dollars per home per quarter that equates to tens of thousands in unearned income for the convenience of not having to mail a check. Other management firms have credit card, debit card, ACH and other electronic processing means for a lot less.

I understand how things work in property management as 10 years ago I used to work for a property management company as a property manager. Therefore, their side stepping questions did not work with me.  Once I started digging into things with my fellow Board members we found tons of errors.  They paid other associations bills with our funds, even paid a homeowners personal bill with our funds just because the bill came in the mail to them - no approval obtained, overcharged late fees (which by their contract they get 50% of).  Once pointing out these errors and having to follow up constantly to get our funds back they kept getting more and more hostile for us simply saying ""hey what happened here and we need to get reimbursed for this error"".  We tried to be as cooperative as possible knowing that mistakes happen.  Our position was lets correct the issues and move forward.  We were having so much trouble with our property manager once we started pointing out the errors that we requested a meeting with their President, Paul.  It took 3 months to get a response to our request for a meeting.  We finally met with Paul and it was easy to see where the culture of arrogance comes from.  They dodged and side stepped addressing the fact of all their undeniable errors and instead focused on telling us how much time we were costing them each month.  Not giving any sympathy for the time their errors were costing us and we don't get paid for our time - they do! We were pretty much self managing because we couldn't get any real help from our property manager for the last several months so really all they were doing was taking phone calls from homeowners (if the homeowners could ever get through their phone system and actually get a call back from a message) and receiving and depositing checks.  There is no way they were spending the amount of time they stated on our account.  And yes I will say as a Board could we have been a bit more organized and decisive at times but can't all Boards?  We are volunteers thus the need for a management company to guide us and advise us which our property manager Scott was 100% not doing.  If he had managed us correctly we would not have been all over the place trying to resolve the items ourselves.  We ultimately decided things were never going to change and are currently transitioning to a new management company.  We have 26 days left with Cedar and we can't wait to move on.  We thought their service was bad before we let them know we were not renewing out contract now it has just been ridiculous.  Beyond not answering our direct questions Scott is now trying to make things more difficult for us in any way he can....he would never go out of his way to help us but yet he goes out of his way to hurt us.  Very unprofessional and immature.  We have spoken to other local Board Members that also utilize Cedar in our area and found they have experienced the same problems...erroneous homeowner accounts, increased delinquency due to erroneous accounts, homeowners unable to get return phone calls or get through their phone system, Board requests not being completed timely if at all, arrogant attitude, side stepping questions and and best of all when confronted their standard of operations is to blame the board.  Do not recommend this company at all!",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cwKwpVQ_4vI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucnxL8vkTtzrq3ewVjhLI5T5oT-viw/c0x00000000-cc-rp-ba3/photo.jpg,Please feel free to contact us at help@mycmg.com.

I have been told by many strangers how nice my house looks but it seems that some jealous neighbors that choose not to invest time or money into their homes want to cause problems for me and the HOA threatens to fine for every issue brought by board members.

Its these little things that separate the good companies from the bad. This company isn't even working with us to remedy the situation. Email after email keeps getting pushed off or they are requesting we pay for ""another"" pass. This is all over a pool pass!! I can only imagine if I had to deal with a real issue.

They have a termination fee of around $3000 hidden in their contracts that HOA's have to pay them when they figure out how incompetent Cedar service and management is.

There are no hidden fees in our contract. All fees are outlined in detail and also reviewed with the board prior to signing an agreement. The entire length of the contract is less than four pages. We also take time to review the agreement with the board so they have time to review and ask questions prior to signing.

I am simply a homeowner that paid his dues online and could not get a response in regards to whether or not my pool pass would be activated in time for the weekend.  I got a response to my email asking the question but the answer did not answer the question at all.  They simply stated that I still had a balance.  What?  I included my confirmation number in the email but apparently they skipped over that.  Ended up having to leave a message with their call center, stated verbatim what  was in my email and got a call back from them saying that they never received my email and that I still had a balance. Finally found out that I had a $20 late fee that I did not pay since the website does not have the capability of showing you your current balance.  Why they charge $12.95 for the website payment is beyond my understanding.  For that service charge you should be able to view your account.

With all that said, as far as management companies are concerned, communication is a major issue.  They also lack the ability to enforce any HOA rule.  Our neighborhood has a bad parking problem and Cedar has yet to actually enforce any of their towing threats.  They seem more concerned about shutter paint.  They get an A++ for being able to collect money though, seems that's the only thing they're concerned about.

As the management group, the generic answer of ""we will create a ticket"" or ""we will contact your community manager"" is always the response.  A special assessment has been assessed in our HOA dues as long as I've lived there.  The board members and the beyond tacky delivery of the HOA meetings are a sight to witness.  In my last request for a pothole to be fixed was sent in well over 9 months ago.  Of course the generic response was provided. Yet, when CMG needs payment or anything else, they send very detailed, yet threatening documentation stating that you have 15 days to comply.  However to get anything fixed or addressed, it takes 15 months or longer because the board has to send out feelers for quotes and see if they will approve the request.  Very tacky operation.  I wish the few homeowners of Michael's Landing would take a stand. If this is truly an effective management group, then act accordingly. Especially since the board members are required to be homeowners, but most of them own multiple properties to rent out or don't live on the property themselves. This shows how they value the community because they hardly see the problems since they DON'T live there; but they own, so they can get away with it.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GilSMI6covkOVtAymzg_Wmc7uEJqwxZCo5h4uvbSw,"Dee - We are always here to assist and help you.

I pay $192 per month in HOA fees and am completely baffled by the lack of urgency in any matters brought to their attention.  I contacted them on June 4th, 2018 about an exterior leak on my town home that was causing the water (during rainstorms) to get into my windows and leak down through my house into the 2nd floor (it's a 3 story town home) into my kitchen through the windows directly below the third floor windows.  At first, I was contacted saying to allow a vendor 2 weeks to contact me regarding repairs.  That would have put me at June 28th, 2018 where I could have at least expected to have a date set for repairs.  Today it is July 11, 2018 and I just received an email from the maintenance department asking for my phone number since they didn't have it on file (which they must have lost because i filled out paperwork regarding my vehicle, address, phone number, etc.).  I am completely dissatisfied with this company and will be bringing it to my boards attention at our next meeting on the Monday, July 16.  It is absolutely ridiculous that residents are required to pay $192 per month for it to take OVER A MONTH to even have someone call you about fixing an issue that could affect your home in many ways.  Since June 4th, it has rained several times and each time that water leaks into my home causes more damage.  If you're looking for a property management company DO NOT choose Cedar Management Group.  For what seems to be such a simple job of contacting a vendor/contractor to repair an exterior window leak, they can't even handle that.

Not to mention our community pool was closed last week and nobody received an email regarding the matter.  No communication whatsoever and are terrible at answering customer complaints.",https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-em0q_tL6rls/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucn8mG3JhKjoZFHZFeyeDbl_2UCgTQ/c0x00000000-cc-rp/photo.jpg,"Ryan, we are very sorry to hear about this experience. We are following up with the maintenance department and the contractor about what happened. A work order was dispatched to an approved contractor and everything was approved to repaired. We will investigate this issue with the contractor to find out what has happened. We will also be calling you soon to rectify this situation. Thank you for bringing it to our attention.

Update: Ryan, upon further review of this situation, we were able to trace down what happened. The original request was received on June 4th and we notified The Board the same day. The Board requested an estimate before repairs were made and a quote request was sent immediately. We received the estimate back 4 business days later which was approved the same day. The contractor found what he believed was the source of the leak and made repairs. When it rained again, the leaks still happened. We have dispatched a contractor to make the necessary repairs and try to find the origin of the leak.

Exterior water leaks can be hard to trace down. Once a repair is made, we have to wait until more rainy weather to fully ensure the leak does not happen again.",1531322346,7/11/2018 15:19,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m5!14m4!1m3!1m2!1s114805393519271509113!2s0x0:0xa3432a72da873d77?hl=en-US,1,1531315412,7/11/2018 13:23,12

Be very careful and do your research. I was shocked to see that they still have an A+ rating on the Better Business Bureau website, but as I now look deeper there are multiple locations for the same company. We’ve had our HOA managed by Cedar Management out of N. Carolina for 2yrs now and the only thing they’ve managed to do for our homeowners is almost bankrupt our HOA account by nickel and dimming us for everything.

During the initial meeting with the management representative and while preparing to switch over to Cedar Management from Prime Financial we were promised a whole variety of services. It almost sounded to good to be true. Everything from monthly inspection and enforcement of the bylaws & covenants, collections, legal representation, etc.  all for a monthly fee of $675. Then slowly the additional fees for administration, mailing, account maintenance, etc. started rolling in. Eventually we noticed our monthly management fees were up around $1,200 to $1,300 a month.

Cedar Management also has a standard $395 transfer fee charged to every new homeowner at closing. This fee is supposed to be for transferring the account into Cedars HOA database, providing a welcome packet with HOA Bylaws & Covenants, and ensuring there’s no past fines on the dead. The HOA never sees any of this money, most homeowners complained of never receiving the covenants, and home owners accounts are far from up to date with any type of accuracy.

During our time managed by Cedar our HOA Green Space taxes were left unpaid for two years to where they were threatened to go up for auction by the city of Sumter. Then when paid after multiple board members had to get  involved they had hefty late fees, all of which Cedar gladly paid out of the HOA account trying to take no accountability.

While digging into the 75 scanned pages of mess they email monthly we noticed every bill was always paid late and had incurred late fees. That just seemed to be standard operating procedure for them. All at the Homeowners Association expense.

The drive through inspections for violation were never scheduled and very sporadic and by the time the letters went out 3 weeks later the 10 day notice to cut the lawn was no good and unenforceable. Cedar never really tracked the violations for enforcement or fines anyways. So tenants would receive the same violation month after month all with an expected completion date never resulting in a fine.

Then when the neighborhood continually started to look worse and worse due to constant unenforceable violation letters and the HOA board discussed taking a few accounts to court for collections, we were told oh no we actually don’t have lawyers for the HOA they’re only to protect Cedar. Causing the HOA board to once again do all of the leg work that we thought we were paying for.

In the past two years the HOA Board has continually asked for many issues to be corrected to continually find out that our representative at Cedar has quit and we’re being assigned a new rep, then the new representative claims no knowledge of any complaints or issues starting the entire process over again. It’s like a black hole.

I will be so glad to see 1 August 2018, when we no longer have to deal with this company and can finally start getting our Homeowners Association back to where it should be.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhF05i47q9KlZGtcyi2gzQhaR4LwAYkhUASFkLorQ,"Thank you for your comments, one of our staff members will reach out to you to discuss these concerns.  We provide our boards with a detailed and comprehensive financial report each month.  Any additional fees charged were disclosed in our management agreement and were read by the board prior to signing.  Additionally, we provide new homeowners with information about their community and our website portal, where governing documents are always available to homeowners.

In regards to the collections and violations issues, we work with several attorney firms that can represent the association. If an account is delinquent, we can turn over the account to a law firm with board approval. The board does not have to do any ""leg work"" in these situations. In regards to the violations, we work directly with the board on how they want to address them. In order for fines to be processed, a hearing is required by law and the board is responsible for those hearings. If the board does not hold hearings, then we cannot assess a fine.

CEDAR MANAGEMENT is a Horrible Company. Customer Service is bad, unprofessional, and unreliable. It takes forever to get in touch with anyone.  I have tried contacting the President, numerous times but he seems to be out on his yacht.  DO NOT PAY BILLS On-LINE, they charge 15 dollars extra for the process if the process works. They don't tell you about that one in the little print.   We have tried 3 different times to set up bill pay before we found out they nickel and dime you.   If it works it may take hold for that month but the Bill Pay On-Line never works right. Even if you send it in the mail, they still classify it as late.  They don't send letters to stat you haven't paid until it's too late and you owe thousands of dollars, PLUS Court Costs. They will and Love to take you to COURT. They must be in together with certain law Firms to rip tax paying owners. God forbid you a have an issue with your property. They won't return your calls and basically, they don't care about you or your property.  It's a shame that we don't see where our HOA Fees go too. Our Condo Complex is in shambles while the CEO is on his yacht that we paid for.  Must be nice to Rip people off while cruising on Lake Norman.   Cedar Management has nothing good to offer any person or business. If you’re looking to do business with these shady characters Good Luck, but I would look to some other business.   Some other company who cares about the homeowners; and has ethical business values.

It is our job to help the Board of Directors and the homeowners maintain a high standard for the entire community. We do not send accounts to an attorney for being a few days late. We always send past due reminders to give an owner an opportunity to make payment arrangements. If we do not receive a response, the HOA's Board of Directors will advise us on how they want us to proceed with follow-up. If owners have a past due balance, the HOA can revoke the pool pass until the account is made current. Please email us at help@mycmg.com and include your association's name and your property address so we can help you discuss payment arrangements.

EDIT: Rashawnda, we have looked into your account and there are still issues with your account balance.

We are sorry to hear about your review. We had one of our IT staff investigate this issue since nobody in our Payment Plan department received those messages. Unfortunately your original emails were marked as Spam. Google does not notify us when this occurs and we are confused as to why this was happening with our Payment Plan department but not our Community Support Department, which received your emails and responded to them. Below is a link to a screenshot where you can see the pending messages that were being held. We have whitelisted your email address in our Google Gmail account so this does not happen again.

Everything was rainbows and fairydust and neverland ranch for the first year.  Then Cedar became the new mngt company.  Dues have increased every year; they had their lawyers find loopholes to force homeowners to pay for fixing our roofs during the hail damage (by-laws blatantly state shingles are HOA's responsibility); they create new surreptitious by-laws on a whim; amenities and general landscape aesthetics have fallen off drastically or remain broken for years; and overall they've perniciously created an atmosphere of despondency.  The reps responsible for answering the phone, and therefore helping you, are the most worthless dysentery-humanoids that eugenics failed to prevent.
